# Packet-sniffer
A short project on using a packet sniffer to understand SYN attacks.
This project is based off of Google's cybersecurity certification. It asks for us to evaluate an issue that costumers were getting with an error on a website.
The first slide shows the Scenario, followed by the cybersecurity report. Slides 5-9 show the attack, how it starts and what the natural progression is.
